# discord-experience



The bot creates a database in sqlite 3 and when someone join in your discord will create a row with differents characteristics 

(id, remote, name, level .. etc)


when you send a message  in the authorized channel you will gain a xp. You have some restrictions (not really hard to understand). 


you have the function rank who will give the first 10 people and your rank.


Then you have 2 functions no_channel_xp and channel xp, 
you have to give the channel_id  and this channel will not be able to gain xp.

Logically channel_xp will remove this "interdiction"


If you use this bot, star this repository :D
