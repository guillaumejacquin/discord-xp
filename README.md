# discord-experience


I had a bug, so i did 2 bots with 2 token (can't call function i don't know why).


The fist bot creates a database in sqlite 3 and when someone join in your discord will create a row with differents characteristics 

(id, remote, name, level .. etc)


when you send a message  in the authorized channel you will gain a xp. You have some restrictions (not really hard to understand).
